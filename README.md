## Todo
- [ ] Setup script.

Make sure to add\
`cfg update-index --skip-worktree ~/zshcustom/customtheme.zsh-theme`\
`cfg update-index --skip-worktree ~/README.md`\
to the script after removal of files.\
zshcustom folder is there because I can't seem to upload `.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/customtheme.zsh-theme` so make sure to put the file there in setup script.
